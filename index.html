        <h2>A Special Message for You</h2>
        <p>Ms. Innocent,</p>
        <p>From the day I first saw you on November 13, three years ago, our story beganâ€”a bond that time could never weaken. We've shared memories that are now part of who we are, a connection that's both silent and strong. Through every laugh, every tear, and every moment of understanding, you've been my constant, my friend, my promise.</p>
        <p>Here's to more shared dreams, unspoken promises, and the unbreakable thread that ties us together. Thank you for being you and for letting me be part of this incredible journey with you.</p>
        <p>With all the gratitude and warmth, today and always.</p>
